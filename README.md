#  Netflix Dashboard (Tableau Project)

This project is an interactive dashboard built with Tableau to explore and analyze Netflix's movie and TV show dataset. The project involved data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling to uncover content trends on the platform.


## Project Overview

The dashboard provides an analytical overview of Netflix’s content library, focusing on:

-  Distribution of content over the years
